## Big Question
How do the scoring averages of golfers from decades past compare against the golfers of today?

## Motivation
I chose this topic becuase my family loves to play golf, I played golf competitively all through high school and I still play recreationally. Every August a large golf tournament called the Boeing Classic comes to Snoqualmie where lots of older but still legendary golfers will play, and it made me think how their scoring average in their prime compares to the golfers who are currently in the PGA like Dustin Johnson or Tiger Woods.

## Data Set
I pulled this data from the PGA Tour website which listed the scoring averages of players dating back to 1980. Using the Masters as a control since it takes place at the exact same golf course so I had some resemblence of a control. In order to keep load light I picked the beginning of each decade (like 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010). As far as cleaning goes I didn't have to clean that much because it was already done ahead of time by the PGA.

## What I Could Improve on
When you look at the data, the amount of times a person appears at the Masters varies, I'm sure there is a way to compare each of the golfers on a level playing field but I did not know how to do that
